If you already maintain and update one or more calendars, you might not think calendar functionality is a vital component of Project Management Software. A task management app that includes calendars, on the other hand, has various advantages that other calendar solutions do not. Traditional calendars, for example, are fantastic for arranging your day but poor for planning, visualizing and discussing project work. While your online calendar may remind you of an imminent deadline, it is not meant to inform you what tasks are necessary to reach the deadline, who is working on them, and where they are in the completion process. You'd have to leave the software (or write an email) to find that vital information.
